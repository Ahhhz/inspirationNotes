# inspirationNotes
  Just some thoughts and goals that I have include a couple different websites. The first site that I frequent and that I love their layout is [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/). Their first article always sits in its own container making it the focus of the site, as you can see for example here ![article](https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/01/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-trial-the-intercept-15-1483738418-article-header.jpg). That example image there had to do with the main story they were running on 01/09/2017. Within that image there is a link that takes you to that article. Another two elements that I like about that site is their side sliding nav on the left hand side. Although it is a bit on the clunky side(feel like the container the nav sits in is too big)the sliding out aspect of it is what I think makes it cool. The other element I enjoy is the animation on one particular header and once that header is clicked you are brought to another part of the site where the header has [video animation running behind it](https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/).
  
   I currently work for a Volkwagen dealership in Linden NJ so often times I need to visit the actual Volkswagen website. I have sat at work and have tinkered with the site many times and what I like the most is the [360 degree animation that is done when "building your own car"](http://www.vw.com/models/jetta/trims/2017/2017-14t-s-trim/edit/tab/exterior/exterior-color/0q0q/). You can change the color of the car and see it change in front of your eyes as well as move the car around 360 degrees to see whole car from each angle. Now as much as I like this I also feel like it is a little basic I would actually want to tweek a couple things here and there. One thing I would want to improve or to have in a site I would build is the same type of 360 degree rotation that is done on the exterior of the car done on the inside when looking at the interiror. Instead they have that part of the site built as a slide show of picturtes of the interior. An example of this 360 animation is on [BMW's webiste](http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/mseries/m3sedan/2014/showroom/design/visualizer.html). Now, again I feel like it can be worked on because it seems to be a bit small. I would want to set one up where it would **_really_** feel like you are in the drivers seat of the vehicle looking around.
   
   The [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/) has to be one of the most sleekest sites I have seen to date. Its homepage is so simple but the colors and design is what makes it pop for me. The Brilliance of Elon Musk is personified in the sites of his companies. There is no doubt in my mind that what is seen on the sites does not come straight from his mind as far as his envision goes. In navigating through the SpaceX website you can take a gander at the [Falcon 9](http://www.spacex.com/falcon9) rocket. In this section of the site I like how the description of each section of the rocket is in its own grid rigt next to the figure. Also that the rocket itsef has some points on it that you can expand to learn more about that part of the rocket. It may be something small but the + symbol that you can click on to learn more about the rocket turns into a x once it is clicked on. That small intricate animation of that button shows the funcitonality of how the small things catch peoples eyes. Another section of the site has the [Dragon](http://www.spacex.com/dragon) spacecraft disassembles while you scroll down to its respective description and specs of each section, up until you reach the payload portion and the trunk payload opens up. The parallax scrolling is something I would like to apply to a build at some point in my career. 

These are some of the things I would love to learn and apply into my designs. I am sure throughout this coding experience I will come to see more things that catch my eye and see how other things catch the publics eyes and apply those trends to my works. I hope to look back at these notes in the near or far off future and be able to revel in what I have done or be able to add more inspiration as I go along my journey.
