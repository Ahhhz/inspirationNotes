  Just some thoughts and goals that I have include a couple different websites. The first site that I frequent and that I love their layout is [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/). Their first article always sits in its own container making it the focus of the site, as you can see for example here ![article](https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/01/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-trial-the-intercept-15-1483738418-article-header.jpg). That example image there had to do with the main story they were running on 01/09/2017. Within that image there is a link that takes you to that article. Another two elements that I like about that site is their side sliding nav on the left hand side. Although it is a bit on the clunky side(feel like the container the nav sits in is too big)the sliding out aspect of it is what I think makes it cool. The other element I enjoy is the animation on one particular header and once that header is clicked you are brought to another part of the site where the header has [video animation running behind it](https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/).
  
   I currently work for a Volkwagen dealership in Linden NJ so often times I need to visit the actual Volkswagen website. I have sat at work and have tinkered with the site many times and what I like the most is the [360 degree animation that is done when "building your own car"](http://www.vw.com/models/jetta/trims/2017/2017-14t-s-trim/edit/tab/exterior/exterior-color/0q0q/). You can change the color of the car and see it change in front of your eyes as well as move the car around 360 degrees to see whole car from each angle. Now as much as I like this I also feel like it is a little basic I would actually want to tweek a couple things here and there. One thing I would want to improve or to have in a site I would build is the same type of 360 degree rotation that is done on the exterior of the car done on the inside when looking at the interiror. Instead they have that part of the site built as a slide show of picturtes of the interior. An example of this 360 animation is on [BMW's webiste](http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/mseries/m3sedan/2014/showroom/design/visualizer.html). Now, again I feel like it can be worked on because it seems to be a bit small. I would want to set one up where it would **really** feel like you are in the drivers seat of the vehicle looking around.
