Just some thoughts and goals that I have include a couple different websites. The first site that I frequent and that I love their layout is [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/). Their first article always sits in its own container making it the focus of the site, as you can see for example here ![article](https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/01/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-trial-the-intercept-15-1483738418-article-header.jpg). That example image there had to do with the main story they were running on 01/09/2017. Within that image there is a link that takes you to that article. Another two elements that I like about that site is their side sliding nav on the left hand side. Although it is a bit on the clunky side(feel like the container the nav sits in is too big)the sliding out aspect of it is what I think makes it cool. The other element I enjoy is the animation on one particular header and once that header is clicked you are brought to another part of hte site where the header has [video animation running behind it](https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/).
